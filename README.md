# üóïÔ∏è Kalander ‚Äì A Svelte Calendar System

> **Kalander** (pronounced *Kal-Lander*) is a modular, composable system for building calendar-driven UIs like weekly schedulers, planners, and appointment tools ‚Äî all within the Svelte framework.

## üîß Purpose

Kalander is not a UI component ‚Äî it's an **architecture**.

It gives structure to calendar logic, date manipulation, layout geometry, and time slot organization, so you can build your own scheduler UIs without reinventing core mechanics.

Rather than being a single component, Kalander is a **network of cooperating modules**, each responsible for one aspect of the calendar's logic.

---

## üßπ Mental Model

Kalander is made up of **three primary modules**:

| Module             | Responsibility                                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `KalanderManager`  | Central controller ‚Äî orchestrates all other pieces |
| `TimeSlotManager`  | Handles time slot logic like filtering & overlap   |
| `CalendarGeometry` | Calculates how time translates to pixels on screen |

These parts plug into your Svelte UI components, providing a unified logic layer that can be reused across views, modals, and toolbars.

---

## üïπÔ∏è The Flow of Data

Here's how everything connects when you build with Kalander:

```
          +---------------------+
          |     Kalander UI     | ‚Üê e.g. your <Calander /> or toolbar
          +---------------------+
                   |
         passes props / reacts to changes
                   |
                   v
        +------------------------+
        |   KalanderManager()    |
        +------------------------+
         |           |           |
     context     geometry    timeSlots
     (selected   (height,    (filtering,
      date)       layout)     collision)

```

Each sub-module focuses on one thing:

* **TimeSlotManager** deals with *what exists*: appointments, blocks, data.
* **CalendarGeometry** deals with *how it looks*: converting `10:30` to pixel height.
* **KalanderManager** brings it together and reacts to the selected day or week.

---

## üß† How It Feels to Use

When working with Kalander:

* You **create a `KalanderManager`** in your parent layout.
* You **bind it** to components like `<Calander />` and `<Toolbar />`.
* You **feed it raw time slot data**, and it tells you which time slots belong to which day, what their screen height should be, and how they relate.
* You use its **context object** to track the currently selected day reactively.

---

## üåç Example Integration

```svelte
<script>
	import KalanderManager from './managers/KalanderManager.svelte';
	const kalander = KalanderManager();

	let timeSlots = $state.raw([...]); // your appointment data
</script>

<Calander kalanderManager={kalander} timeSlotData={timeSlots} />

<Toolbar bind:currentSelectedDate={kalander.context.currentSelectedCalanderDate} />
```

> Other components like `<RepeatAppointment />` or `<ScheduleTypeModal />` are optional extras, not core to Kalander ‚Äî but Kalander integrates with them easily via its shared state.

---

## üîÑ What Kalander Does For You

* Keeps a **timezone-aware "now"** value (`currentDatePacific`) so your calendar is always accurate.
* Maintains a **central context** of the currently selected day.
* Provides a **clean separation** of:

  * Geometry (`hour ‚Üí pixels`)
  * Logic (`which slots belong to which day`)
  * Data (`where is the user focused in the calendar`)
* Makes **UI composition** predictable and declarative.

---

## üìö Why Use Kalander?

Kalander is perfect if you're building:

* A scheduling dashboard
* A weekly planner
* An appointment booking interface
* A time-blocking productivity tool

And you want:

* Clean separation of logic and layout
* A scalable foundation for calendar features
* To work with **Temporal**, not fragile `Date` objects

---

## üß† Summary

Kalander is:

* **Not** a monolithic calendar component
* **Not** opinionated about your UI
* **A modular brain** for calendar UIs ‚Äî it lets you plug logic into whatever visual design you want

It helps your Svelte calendar stay accurate, maintainable, and extensible ‚Äî without duplicating logic across your views.
